# General info
Air travel is one of the quickest ways of public transportation for crossing international borders. An airline company collects the data of the number of passengers that have traveled with them on a particular route for the past few years. This data is used to gather insights on passengers travel patterns. With the help of this data they can see and forecast the number of passengers for the next twelve months.

Project was Time Series Analysis, used ARIMA method to build the model. Major steps involved were as follow :

    STEP: 1 - Data Cleaning and Analysis
    STEP: 2 - Checking Stationarity (ADF Test)
    STEP: 3 - Transformation
    STEP: 4 - Differencing
    STEP: 5 - Time Series Components
    STEP: 6 - Finding ACF and PACF
    STEP: 7 - ARIMA Modeling
    STEP: 8 - Forecast

## Making this projection could be advantageous to the Airline companies because it will assist them in making important decisions such as â€“

    What kind of plane should they fly?
    When shall they take off?
    How many flight attendants and pilots do they require?
    How much food should they have on hand at their warehouse?

The forecasting is done on the Time Series data. Training has been done with an ARIMA model. To convert the available time series into a stationary time series, techniques
such as moving average and differencing were applied. The suitable values of p, d, and q for ARIMA were established by plotting ACF and PACF.

  ## Dataset used for Forecasting

The Air passengers dataset is downloaded from kaggle click here. This dataset gives information of monthly passengers totals of a US airline from 1949 to 1960. This report analyse the data using suitable time series model and forecasts the number of passengers for the next 24 months.

## Conclusion of Forecasting Air Passengers count using Time series Analysis

In this project the training has been done with an ARIMA model and successfully achieved a good accuracy rate after forecasting. The predicted values are approximately similar to the actual values. In the future, This model can be modified and can be utilized for forecasting in various scenarios.
The forecasting shows with 95% confidence that in the next 10years the number of passengers wiill grow.
